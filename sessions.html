                <h3>Session 1: Into Hollowmere</h3>
                <p>We crossed into Hollowmere under a sky stitched with wrong memories. Broken streets and ghost-lanterns greeted us, flickering with forgotten names. There we met Bartending Bob — a simulacrum trapped between stories, guarding a tavern at the edge of erosion. Hollowmere was not dead. It was waiting. And with each step forward, something ancient stirred in the marrow of the world.</p>

                <h3>Session 2: No One Left to Serve... except you 3... or 4, or 5?</h3>
                <p>The tavern swayed under the weight of lost time, and Bob struggled to remember who he was serving. Us? Or the shadows? Memories looped like cracked records — faces flickered, loyalties blurred. Every laugh, every drink, every promise felt rehearsed, as if even kindness was being read from a script we could no longer see. Hollowmere forgot who it was waiting for. Maybe we had, too.</p>

                <h3>Session 3: The Forge Remembers, But Do You?</h3>
                <p>Deep beneath the village, the air turned hot and metallic. Forgotten machinery clanked in rhythms we almost recognized — songs without words. At the heart of it, a broken forge hissed in defiance, stubbornly alive. As we pressed forward, memories clung to the heat, forcing us to choose: remember who we were, or be reforged into something the forge needed instead.</p>

                <h3>Session 4: Below the Silent Village</h3>
                <p>We slipped below Hollowmere into a labyrinth of drowned streets and hollow halls. No footsteps echoed. No prayers reached the broken chapel vaults. Only the heavy quiet of a village that remembered it had once been sacred — and had been abandoned anyway. Every door we opened, every relic we touched, pulled the silence closer, until even our own voices seemed like intrusions.</p>

                <h3>Session 5: Where Memory Fails, the Body Rises</h3>
                <p>As memories frayed, flesh obeyed different rules. Puppeted shadows, stitched from forgotten bodies, rose against us. They wore the faces of the past — wrong and right at once. Fighting them was like fighting against being forgotten ourselves. Every strike we made felt like severing another tie to who we had been before Hollowmere decided otherwise.</p>

                <h3>Session 6: For Whom It Was Written</h3>
                <p>Through broken thresholds, we found the Blanetarium Archive: a labyrinth where every name was a sigh against a dark sky. Pages fluttered, rewritten, redacted by unseen hands. We traced lives barely remembered, including our own. We glimpsed the truth: Hollowmere wasn't decaying — it was being edited. And the question was not whether we would survive, but whether we would still recognize ourselves afterward.</p>

                <h3>Session 7: The Patron Saint of Poor Decisions</h3>
                <p>At the height of collapse, when history splintered into nonsense and shadowspawn tore at the last standing walls, Velgrin arrived — grinning, bleeding, magnificent. Patron Saint of Poor Decisions and Impromptu Goodbyes. He taught us that memory could be defied, even if only by laughter, absurdity, and reckless courage. In the end, defiance might be the only true memory left untouched.</p>

                <h3>Session 8: Velgrin's Last Stand</h3>
                <p>Velgrin fought alongside us in the ruined tavern square, laughter sharp as bullets, cloak torn like the last page of a story no one wanted to end. The echoes of forgotten names howled through Hollowmere’s bones. As walls crumbled and shadow-things surged, we fought — not to win, but to make losing beautiful enough to remember. And far beyond, the ritual circle of Vareth-Khul began to burn.</p>

                <h3>Session 9: Anemoia</h3>
                <p>We awoke around a flickering campfire, surrounded by survivors who clung to their stories as shields against oblivion. Names. Stories. What changed. That was the liturgy now. A broken warforged — T.A.M.A.R.I.N.D. — delivered the final truth: Mulch had always been Vareth-Khul. At the throne of memory, Velgrin gave us relics of resistance. Wayfarer — now Unravel — accepted a legacy not of fate, but of choice, becoming a chimera of kenku and genasi blood. A sunkissed autumn leaf drifted into his hands. And as Hollowmere shifted around us, we seized our last stolen breath and ran — toward the ritual, toward Vareth, toward the end of remembering.</p>

                <h3>Bracers of Archery</h3>
                <p>Worn leather bracers marked with faint silver lines, shaped like the arcs of long-forgotten stars. They feel warm to the touch, as if waiting for a bow to remember them.</p>

                <h3>Mnemonic Lens</h3>
                <p>A single cracked lens, set in a frame of silver and obsidian. Etched around its rim are notes in a hand you almost recognize, though you have no memory of writing them. It glows faintly when turned toward places that shouldn't exist.</p>

                <h3>Name Tag of the Forgotten Passenger</h3>
                <p>A simple adhesive name tag that reads <strong>"My Name Is ____"</strong>. The writing fades and reforms constantly, as if even the paper cannot hold onto who you are.</p>

                <h3>The Melody of Silent Steps</h3>
                <p>A tarnished music box made of black iron and pale driftwood, carved with faceless dancers spiraling along its sides. Its crank turns without resistance, playing a song almost too soft to hear — a melody that brushes against memory like a forgotten dream.</p>

                <h3>Transfer Token</h3>
                <p>A small coin made from pearlescent metal, unnaturally smooth. Its surface bears shifting patterns of swirling lines and a wide, knowing grin — a face that changes whenever you glance away.</p>

                <h3>The Bag</h3>
                <p>A worn sack stitched with thread from unknown creatures. It hums faintly, like something living breathes inside. The opening seems to flicker between dimensions when left unattended too long.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>Paper of Plausibility</h3>
                <p>A brittle scroll of faded parchment, impossibly delicate. When unrolled, the ink shifts slightly — rewriting itself in forgotten languages only glimpsed out of the corner of the eye. It smells faintly of salt, ash, and hope.</p>

            <h2>Gifts of the Forgotten</h2>

            <article>
                <h3>Cloak of Poor Decisions</h3>
                <p>A flamboyant violet cloak stitched from drama and dusk. When thrown over the shoulders, it billows as if caught by invisible winds — proud, reckless, and just a little tragic. It smells faintly of gunpowder, applause, and broken promises.</p>

                <h3>Brooch of Forgetful Memory</h3>
                <p>A small silver brooch in the shape of a snake devouring its own tail, but the tail splits in two before it closes. It hums when held close to the heart, as if it remembers what you should not — or forgets what you needed to know.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>Sunkissed Autumn Leaf</h3>
                <p>A single leaf of brilliant gold and burnt orange, caught forever in mid-fall. It seems to shimmer between seasons, pulsing gently with a promise of unfinished stories and skies that refuse to be forgotten.</p>

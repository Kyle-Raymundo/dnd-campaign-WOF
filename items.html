                <h3>Bracers of Archery</h3>
                <p>While wearing these bracers, you have proficiency with the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/37-longbow" target="_blank">Longbow</a> and <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/17-shortbow" target="_blank">Shortbow</a>, and you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls made with such weapons.</p>

                <h3>Mnemonic Lens</h3>
                <p>A single lens, cracked but polished, set in an intricate frame of silver and obsidian. Etched along the rim are notes in Elara’s own handwriting, though they have no memory of writing them. The lens glows faintly when viewing things that should not be remembered.</p>

                <h3>Name Tag of the Forgotten Passenger</h3>
                <p>A simple adhesive name tag that says <strong>“My Name Is ____”</strong>, but the writing fades constantly.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Any creature you interact with while wearing this tag forgets you exist for 1 minute after you leave their sight.</li>
                    <li>Removing the tag costs one hour of your memories unless you succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Melody of Silent Steps</h3>
                <p>This small, tarnished music box is crafted from black iron and pale driftwood, carved with faceless dancers that spiral endlessly around its sides. When opened, the box reveals a delicate silver crank that winds without resistance. The music it plays is soft, almost too soft to hear, but its influence is undeniable.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>Transfer Token</h3>
                <p>A small, oval-shaped coin made of an unidentifiable, pearlescent metal. Its surface is unnaturally smooth and cool to the touch, and faint, shifting patterns of swirling lines and a wide, grinning face are etched into its center. These markings seem to subtly change each time you glance away.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>The Bag</h3>
                <p>This extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed inside. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed inside, there is a 50% chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can attempt to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength (<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" target="_blank">Athletics</a>) check. Another creature can attempt to pull them out with a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check, provided they are not pulled in themselves. Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.</p>

                <h3>Paper of Plausibility</h3>
                <p>A relic — a final gift from Igan, High Priest of the Spiral Fang, who once held memory sacred. The Paper of Plausibility is not a spell, nor a wish—it is <em>a rewrite</em>: a single, subtle edit to the script of the world, delicate enough not to tear it apart, yet real enough to open what was once closed.</p>

            <h2>About This Campaign</h2>
        <p>This is my website for my players in my D&D campaign, where they can review past events, characters, and magical items.</p>
        <p>They say the gods no longer laugh.  
    They say the world you knew has already been rewritten — and that the last memories of its truth now drift like broken leaves across the Still Abyss.  
Welcome to Whispers of the Forgotten.  
Walk carefully. Speak your name often.  
And remember — even memory can be stolen.</p>

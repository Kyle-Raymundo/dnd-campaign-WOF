                <h3>Unravel (formerly Wayfarer)</h3>
                <p>A chimera of Kenku memory and Water Genasi rewriting. Once Wayfarer, now Unravel — a bridge between the drowned skies and the rewritten tides. His destiny is neither inherited nor abandoned: it is carved anew.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>Tamarrind</h3>
                <p>A soul stitched by faith and memory, torn between the Spiral Fang's fading light and the dangerous promises of the forgotten gods. Carrying the burden of lost scriptures and the last flickers of his original self.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>Slag</h3>
                <p>A High Elf wanderer hollowed by endless recursion. Slag pieces together what was lost, but each answer only births deeper questions. In the ruins of memory, he searches for the shape of who he once was — or who he could become.</p>

                <h3>Bartending Bob</h3>
                <p>A simulacrum crafted from broken prayers and fading memories. Bob tends the tavern at the heart of Hollowmere, holding fast to what fragments of truth remain — even as the world forgets around him.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>Velgrin</h3>
                <p>Patron Saint of Poor Decisions. Gunslinger, dramatist, and last hero of a world that refuses to remember its own mistakes. Velgrin teaches that even doomed rebellions deserve a standing ovation.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>Wiels Rider</h3>
                <p>Once a butler to Queen Belabronta, now a broken cleric in a clockwork wheelchair. Wiels rolls through drowned timelines, offering prayers to gods who no longer listen — and sometimes answers born of silence.</p>

            <hr class="divider">

            <article>
                <h3>Zamir</h3>
                <p>Paladin-Warlock hybrid. High Major Commodore of the Lethal Company. A man stitched together from broken promises and stubborn faith, dragging a trickster god's laughter behind him like a battered shield.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>Nyrah of the Ninth Thread</h3>
                <p>One of the last walkers between timelines. Her world drowned, her god wore too many faces, but she still tugs gently on the threads of destiny — even if the loom itself forgot she was ever there.</p>

                <h3>Mudge</h3>
                <p>First of the Fallen Fang who didn't get back up. Grinning madly, Mudge still hears bubbles of laughter rising from blood — and sometimes answers when no one else dares.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>Kovari Emberbrand</h3>

                <h3>Spud</h3>
                <p>Once a proud Fang knight, now a broken relic of the Spiral. His laughter echoes strangely across the coral-lit chambers of the refuge, half memory, half warning.</p>

                <h3>Esmeralda</h3>
                <p>A tiefling squire spirited away from Hollowmere during the chaos. Bright-eyed and stubborn, unaware she is the spark that could ignite a thousand collapsing stories.</p>

            </article>

            <hr class="divider">

            <article>
                <h3>The Hallowed Warden of the Abyss</h3>
                <p>Silent and remorseless, this guardian of the collapsing shrine wields the echoes of faith like weapons. Neither alive nor dead — only a memory too stubborn to release its grip on the drowned world.</p>

                <h3>Lyra Brightsong</h3>
                <p>A bard who fell into Hollowmere and tried to bring music back to the ruined streets. Erased by Vareth with a whisper, she remains only as a tremor in memory — a song no longer sung.</p>
